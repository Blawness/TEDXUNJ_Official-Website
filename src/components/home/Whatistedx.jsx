        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called
        TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring
        people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called
        TEDxUNJ, where x = independently organized TED Event. At our TEDxUNJ
        event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep
        discussion and connection in a small group. The TED conference provides
        general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx Events,
        including ours, are self-organized.
